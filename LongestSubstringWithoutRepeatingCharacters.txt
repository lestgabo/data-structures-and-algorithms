/*
3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Medium

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Here is an example solution in Python language. (Any language is OK to use in an interview, though we'd recommend Python as a generalist language utilized by companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Dropbox, Pinterest, Uber, etc.,)

class Solution:
  def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
    # Fill this in.

print Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring('abrkaabcdefghijjxxx')
# 10

*/

class Solution {
    lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
        // sliding window technique or 2 pointers
        // hash
        let letters = {};
        let maxLength = 0;
        let curr = 0;

        if (s.length < 2) {
            return s.length;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
            if (letters[s[i]] == null) {
                curr += 1;
            } else {
                curr = Math.min(i - letters[s[i]], curr + 1);
            }
            // console.log(maxLength);
            // console.log(curr);
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, curr);
            letters[s[i]] = i;
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}

ss = 'abrkaabcdefghijjxxx';
ss = 'abcabcbb';
s = 'qwertayuiopfsdgfhjka';
let solution = new Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring(s);
console.log(solution);

JavaScript:

var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    let max_len = 0;
    let curr = 0;
    let hash = {}; 
    if(s.length < 2) {
        return s.length;
    }
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length;  i++) {
        if(hash[s[i]] == null) {
            curr += 1;
        } else {
            curr = Math.min(i - hash[s[i]], curr + 1);
        }
        max_len = Math.max(max_len, curr);
        hash[s[i]] = i; //save the index
    }
    return max_len;
};

The idea behind this code is to use hash maps to keep track of seen substrings.
Obviously if any string is less than two, the longest substring is equal to the length of that substring.
However, if not, then we would have to consider another approach.

Consider a string:
_ _ _ _ _ a _ _ _ _ _ f _ _ _ f _ _ _ a

Where _ means a distinct character from all the others.

As we transverse the string, we put a character into the hash table if it's not already in there where the key is the character and the value is the index. --> hash = {char: index}

If there character is already in the string, we have to update the index after we do the following procedures:

We have a curr that keeps track of the length of the substring that has not seen an already seen character. As we get to the second f, curr = 16. So, so far the max_len is going to be max(max_len = 0, curr = 16) [Since max_len has yet to be updated].

Now, we start our curr from the character after the first f. curr now becomes the distance between the first f and the second f, which is i - hash[s[i]]. We update the hash and continue.

The max_len is determined by the max of the current max_len and the curr value when it encounters a character already seen.

Finally, we have completely transversed the string and arrived at the max length of the substring that does not have any repeating characters.

Space Complexity: O(n)
